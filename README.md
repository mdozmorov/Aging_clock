# Data and papers related to various clocks predicting age

Note the original [Aging](https://github.com/mdozmorov/Aging) repository containing much more [epigenetic clock-related data](https://github.com/mdozmorov/Aging/tree/master/data). This repository is a more systematic attempt to collect aging clock data and should eventually supersede the [Aging](https://github.com/mdozmorov/Aging) repository.

The average methylation change was small (~1.5%), sites were under-represented in canonical regions of epigenetic regulation but enriched in intergenic regions and eQTLs. Tissues show largely similar aging patterns. Association between accelerated epigenetic aging and disease is weak. Introduction to epigenetic clocks (senescence, obesity, cancer). Discussion why age-related variation in methylation at clock loci is small. Elastic net regression, linear regression with interactions (tissue-age interactions are small), non-linear fit is better. Models trained on separate age groups poorly predict across age groups.
