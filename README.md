# Data and papers related to various clocks predicting age

Note the original [Aging](https://github.com/mdozmorov/Aging) repository containing much more [epigenetic clock-related data](https://github.com/mdozmorov/Aging/tree/master/data). This repository is a more systematic attempt to collect aging clock data and should eventually supersede the [Aging](https://github.com/mdozmorov/Aging) repository.

## Reviews

-  Human DNA methylation aging clock, its association with cancer, immune system, metabolism, cell- and nucleic acid processes. Key references to major studies. DNAm clock is different from telomere shortening, BMI, lower than expected in some cancers.

- Short review about methylation (epigenetic) age clock in human and mice. Direct overlap is low, morphogenesis and development are general themes of functional enrichment.
